      Among the many popularised products of modern visual culture there is an image that managed to remain engraved in the common memory and use for almost six decades. <em>The March of Progress</em>, or <em>The Road to Homo Sapiens</em>, drawn in
      1965 by Rudolph Zallinger for the <em>Early Man</en> volume of the Life Nature Library represents a 25 million year long linear progression from a Dryopithecus Primate to the Modern Man. Even though the image has gained a fair amount of
        anthropological criticism and is officially discredited as a scientific refrence, it still remains one of the most iconic and recognizable visuals of our time and is used regularly for both educational and comedic purposes.

          <div class="image-description">March Of Progress</div>
        </div>
        </br>

        Apart from humans and their ancestors only one thing accomppanies the march towards civilastion. A spear.



        As The March Of Progress represents misconceptions, so does The Spear and so do Other Stories.










        It is impossible to achieve an objective view of the world. We see the world and ourselves within it through the stories we tell each other about it. Our experience is an entanglement of personal, idiosyncratic storytelling and the shared
        narratives
        permeating the specific time, land and culture one is situated in.
        </br>

          </div>
        </div>
        </br>

        The stories however, go way beyond those told consciously. Popular fairytales, ancient myths and common fictions are perceived and often appreciated as tools of education and
        entertainment, but never taken too seriously. <span id="stories-trigger" style="cursor: pointer;">Some of the most pervasive stories of our time are also often most dangerous—because we do not see them as stories. </span>They are naturalised,
        taken for granted and seen as a part of objective
        reality.

        </br>
        They are the stories of humans' relationship with nature; stories of the hero and the value of his dominance; stories of progress, objectivity and rationality—even stories about how stories ought to be created. All made up. All naturalised.
        Through the past centuries, the increasingly homogenised
        (western, often colonial and patriarchal) take on these stories has slowly erased and monopolised over the stories told alternatively—by the non-white, non-male, non-cis and indigenous agents.
        </br>
        However, as David Graebner has noticed, "the ultimate hidden truth of the world is that it's something that is made and can as easily be un-made" . The stories could be told differently.
        </br>
        </br>
        Chronologically, one of the first formative stories for humans are the stories of our evolution. The stories of hunters-gatherers and the tools that defined their leap forward towards civilisation. Popular culture provides us with an
        illustration of of that journey. <'The March Of Progress'>, as widely criticised (by anthropologists and evolutionary scientists alike) as it is, has been irreversibly cemented in the common mind. It shows a linear progression of homo sapiens
          from a primitive animal to the proud modern man. That progression is accompanied by one tool. A spear.
          </br>

          Interestingly, the story of human emergence onselectstart a tool of domination and aggression as THE companion of human kind. The ordering of the catgeorisation being 'hunter-gatherer' (and not 'gatherer-hunter') also says a lot about the
          promoted value system.
          </br>
          </br>
          Author Ursula K. Le Guin did not agree with that story. In The Carrier Bag Theory Of Fiction (1986), she suggested that the first defining cultural device of humanity wasn't a spear but a basket. The spear retained its primary
          reputation due
          to the rhetoric of storytelling—it is easier to tell a story of a singular hero killing a mammoth than a collective effort of fruit-picking. But the tool by which Ursula wants to define her female, non-dominant self is a receptacle. A
          thing to
          hold things in. A basket.
          <!-- <div class="graph">
        <img src="images/linegraph.png"></img>
      </div> -->
          </br>
          </br>
          Basketology is a philosophy for alternative storytelling. Informed by Le Guin's explorations, it sees the spear as a manifestation of modern narratives of discrimination, exclusion and domination, and the basket as a tangible
          metaphor of all
          the perspectives that could be told in their place (or rather as their context, extension, net—replacing of one hegeminy with anither is to be avoided). As much as the linear and binary construction of the spear (and its aggressive,
          dominant cultural connotations) relate to the colonial and patriarchal attitudes it represents, the basket, as a
          woven, entangled object, beautifully illustrates the overlooked possibilities of MULTI-DIRECTIONALITY, PLURALITY, NON-ABSOLUTENESS and RECEPTIVITY.
          </br>
          </br>
          Incidentally, these four traits are what constitutes the guiding principles of Basketology .
          <div class="graph">

      </br>
      </br>
      RECEPTIVITY -->
          <!-- </br>
      </br> -->
          By metaphorising these traits as illustrations of physical attributes and cultural connotations of a basket, Basketology aims to explore what kind of narratives can emerge from viewing the world and ourselves within it not through the
          lens of a spear,
          but from a basket perspective. Seeing vacuum-authorship as a myth, these topics are explored in dialogue and in collaboration. Presented here in a form of a podcast series, conversations with Basketologists (people and organizations who
          already apply
          basket-like ways of thinking) inform and enrich all the ideas of Basketology. Immerse yourself in possibilities of crowd-sourced archives, collaborative sport, actions of gathering and... basketry. Try to sit down, listen, meditate. And,
          if you
          just feel like it—weave a basket.

          <p>Surrounded by statues and protagonists it is difficult for us to imagine a world without a hero leading the story. But her-based storytelling results many problematic plots. As Gary Younge suggests, statues reduce a historical event
            to a single person. A revolution that was brought on by collective social effort is presented as a singular, not collective achivement. As Juliette Cezzar notices, "substituting hagiography for history itself is an obsession that we
            should consider letting go; it’s connected to our most corrosive idea, one that is currently enjoying a renaissance: that we are a culture of winners and losers, the winners always deserve to win, and the losers deserve their
            punishment.". The
            veneration of the hero reduces others into victims: those who must be rescued. *“The prototypical savior is a person who has been raised in privilege and taught implicitly or explicitly (or both) that they possess the answers and skills
            needed to rescue others,”.</p>
          <p>Finally, as Mia Mingus states *"We really need to stop putting people on pedestals. It is harmful and dehumanizes all involved. Putting someone on a pedestal is not caring for th. It is not love. You can
            love, admire, adore, learn from, or follow the leadership of someone without putting them on a pedestal.Putting people on pedestals is part of the binary of how we categorize people into “good and “bad.” They are two sides of the same
            coin and they contribute to our collective inability to understand, identify and respond to harm. We demonize people or we put them on pedestals."

          <p>Chronology and time. Geography and maps. Art and canon. Our reality is built on many organizational structures that we take for granted. Their spear-like linearity is so strongly embedded in the way we think and behave that we rarely
            notice them. They seem to serve us well when it comes to the effectiveness of daily communication, but they can also be extremely reductive. They can exclude a vital part of the story instead of weaving it all together in a basket-like
            manner. After all, the map is not the territory. In today’s episode I am speaking with Aggie Toppins—a designer, writer and educator, who, in both her teaching and practice, expresses her doubts about all the default orders of
            reality—from patriarchy to chronology—and proposes that in a deceitfully objective world it is the increased subjectivity that might enlighten our way forward.</p>

          <p>When one thinks about an archive there is a rather clear image that comes to mind. An acclaimed institution
            and its board of experts make curatorial choices about which histories are worth recording and which ones
            should be discarded. A small group of specialised people make daily decisions about objects, documents and
            stories that contribute to the canon and the narratives resulting from it. But in the digital age, perhaps
            more than ever, we can open up the archive. In today’s episode I am joined by Louise Sandhaus—a graphic
            designer, former Program Director and current faculty member of the Graphic Design Program at the California
            Institute of the Arts. In 2018 she started The People’s Graphic Design Archive—an initiative that through
            open-call and open-source structure tries to write a more plural, inclusive and open history of design. A
            virtual archive built by everyone, about everyone and for everyone. Open, plural and receptive—just like a
            basket.</p>

          <p>A woven rattan bowl gets exchanged between players in a joint effort to maintain it in the air for the longest time possible. Everyone plays together—men, women, children and the elders. There are no winners, it is the collaboration, not
            the competition that counts. A mix of play, dance and martial arts with a goal and value placed not in victory, but collective performance of maximal beauty. Sounds utopian? Welcome to Chinlone, the national sport of Myanmar which
            gracefully escapes the aggressive, western understanding of what sport is. In today’s episode I am joined by Manuel Wagner and Clemens Wolter from Chinlone Europe Sports Association. We talk about details of how the game of chinlone is
            played, its role in Myanmar society and how the peaceful, cooperative insights from the sport’s dynamics can be incorporated into the daily life of the players.</p>

          <p>In a hunter-gatherer dichotomy, a basket is the object that is associated with the latter of the subjects. But what would it mean to see oneself as a gatherer in the modern, digital age? In today’s episode I am joined by Mindy Seu—a
            designer, researcher and educator, who in both her Yale School of Art course “On Gathering” and her own practice, explores this question. During our conversation we discuss the possibilities of gathering as authorship, creating space for
            conversation through inclusive archives, forever-in-progressness of online spaces and the fallacies of a binary-oriented cancel culture.

          <p>Before the age of mechanical reproduction, baskets of many forms used to accompany all stages of life—from the basket-like womb to the basket-like tomb. Nowadays however, the art of basketry, often dismissively spoken of as a superfluous
            craft, is almost extinct. In today’s episode I am joined by Esme Hofman, a master basket weaver. We talk about how baskets evolved together with humankind, the position of basketry in the modern world, traits that constitute basketness
            and the philosophical implications carried through the engaged acts of basket-making.
