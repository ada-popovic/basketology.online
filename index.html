      In <span id="stories-trigger" style="cursor: pointer; color:lime;">*The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction*</span>
      (1986), author Ursula K. Le Guin suggests that the first defining cultural device of humanity wasn't a spear but a
      basket. The spear
      retained its primary reputation due to the rhetoric of storytelling—it is easier to tell a story of a singular
      hero killing a mammoth than a collective effort of fruit-picking. Today, the spear manifests itself through
      colonial, binary and
      patriarchal narratives.

      Basketology is a philosophy for alternative storytelling. Through an online podcast platform featuring interviews
      with a variety of basket-minded people the project explores how the physical attributes and cultural associations
      of a basket can
      be
      used as a metaphorical guide for looking at our socio-political landscape and defining ourselves within it.
